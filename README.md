## About

It's Friday night. Dinner rush is coming in. You just got a whole new team of chefs at your disposal and they have no idea what is on the menu. A waiter comes bursting in the kitchen. "Guys! There is a new popular app that just came out that can help us beat this dinner rush!" You look at the app "HotSeat". The waiter says "It will help you prep your meals faster while teaching the other chefs different prep times to get the orders out quickly and deliciously!" You clap your hands to get your teams attention. You yell out "TEAM IT IS TIME TO COOK!"

Hotseat is an app to enable restaurants to streamline the order preparation
process. It gives cooks the tools to coordinate their food prep to ensure
all food comes out synchronized and correctly cooked. It will feature a custom dashboard for
managing your menu and prep instructions. Additionally it will feature the prep stations that
receive orders in real time and guide the staff on how to prep and cook the meal.
